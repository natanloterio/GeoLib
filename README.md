# Geo Library - Interview Exercise

Geo Library is an geospatial library to define locations and trajectories on Earth as well as geospatial areas of different sizes and shapes for no-flying zones.

## Shapes
This library has the following shapes that will allow you tho create Points, Lines, Polylines, Rectangles. And also you will be able to translate those Shapes with any given Vector.


- Point: Represents any location on (or above) Earth.
- Line: Represents a straight line between 2 Points.
- PolyLine: Represents a segmented line between 2 or more Points. 
- Rectangle: Represents a rectangular area, defined by 2 corner 
- Vector: Points. Represents a 3D shift for translation of other 3D objects.
